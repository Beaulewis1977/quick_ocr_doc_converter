# OCR GUI Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated OCR (Optical Character Recognition) features into the Document Converter GUI (`document_converter_gui.py`). The GUI now supports converting both traditional documents (DOCX, PDF, TXT) and images to Markdown format.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added OCR Imports and Initialization
- Imported OCR components from `ocr_engine.ocr_integration` and `ocr_engine.format_detector`
- Added graceful fallback if OCR modules are not available
- Initialize OCR integration and format detector in the GUI constructor

### 2. Enhanced GUI with OCR Mode
- Added OCR Mode toggle section in the UI
- Displays OCR availability status (green if available, red if not)
- Toggle switch to enable/disable OCR processing
- Automatically adjusts window size to accommodate new controls

### 3. Extended File Format Support
- When OCR mode is enabled, the converter now processes image files:
  - JPG/JPEG
  - PNG
  - TIFF/TIF
  - BMP
  - GIF
  - WebP
- Smart PDF detection: checks if PDFs are image-based (scanned) and processes them with OCR

### 4. OCR Processing Implementation
- Added `convert_image_to_markdown()` method for OCR processing
- Added `is_pdf_image_based()` to detect scanned PDFs
- Integrated OCR results with confidence scores
- Shows "(OCR)" indicator for files processed with OCR

### 5. Enhanced User Feedback
- OCR status displayed in the GUI
- Progress indicators show which files are being processed with OCR
- Final summary includes OCR mode status
- Error handling for OCR failures

## Key Features

1. **Seamless Integration**: OCR features work alongside existing document conversion
2. **Smart Detection**: Automatically identifies image-based PDFs that need OCR
3. **User Control**: Easy toggle to enable/disable OCR mode
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators when OCR is being used
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Works without OCR dependencies installed

## Usage

1. Launch the Document Converter GUI
2. Enable "OCR Mode" checkbox (if available)
3. Select input folder containing documents and/or images
4. Select output folder for Markdown files
5. Click "Convert Documents"

## Dependencies

For OCR functionality, the following packages are required:
- pytesseract
- Pillow
- opencv-python
- numpy

The GUI will automatically attempt to install these when OCR mode is first used.

## Testing

A test script (`test_ocr_gui_integration.py`) has been created to verify:
- OCR module availability
- GUI components initialization
- OCR method integration

## File Changes

1. **document_converter_gui.py**:
   - Updated title to "Document to Markdown Converter with OCR"
   - Added OCR imports and initialization
   - Added OCR mode UI elements
   - Extended file patterns for images
   - Added OCR processing methods
   - Enhanced user feedback

2. **test_ocr_gui_integration.py** (new):
   - Comprehensive test suite for OCR integration

## Benefits

- Users can now convert scanned documents and images to searchable text
- Maintains folder structure for batch conversions
- Provides confidence scores for OCR accuracy
- Works with both traditional documents and images in a single interface
